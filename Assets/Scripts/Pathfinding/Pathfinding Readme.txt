# Pathfinding 2D

This is a generic 2D Pathfinding system. It's dependent on a Priority Queue.
Implement INode and IGraph somewhere else in your project, and then create a Pathfinder (new AStarPathfinder(graph)). Then just call TryFindPath.

## Todo:
- Implement as a non-blocking coroutine or async function.
